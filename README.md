# RJQ (Redis Job Queue) for PHP

RJQ is a job queue manager based on Redis and PHP. It's really small, fault tolerant, and quite 
simple to install and use.

## Functionnalities

 * Simple to install and simple to start or track a task
 * Get job server statistics from CLI and Redis
 * Keep job histories during 1 hour
 * Gracefull stop (wait tasks to finish)
 * Clustering capabilities, jobs priorities
 * Fault tolerant (redis crashes, job exceptions, php fatals)
 * Retries after job crash (increment 1sec interval each try)
 * Manage workers allocation depending the load
 * Low task latency (50ms in average)
 * Verbose mode for debug (can also be started from windows for DEVs) 

## Quick start (install it as a daemon)

```bash
  mkdir /etc/rjq
  git checkout https://github.com/sergiula/redis-job-queue.git /etc/rjq
  cp /etc/rjq/bin/rjq_init /etc/init.d/rjq
  ln -s /etc/init.d/rjq /usr/local/bin/rjq
  sudo update-rc.d rjq defaults
  rjq --start
```

You can find more information on the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/sergiula/redis-job-queue/wiki/Install)

## Launch a job with a script

Write your job into a file `/var/my-app/workers/sleep.php` :
```php
<?php
// This script is defines your job
function doSleep( $duration, $name ) {
    sleep($duration);
    echo 'Hello ' . $name;
}
```

Define the job on RJQ configuration `/etc/rjq/config.json` :
```json
{
   ...
    ,"jobs": [
        {
            "name": "doSleep",
            "file": "/var/my-app/workers/sleep.php",
            "workers": 8
        }
    ]
   ...
}
```

You can find more information on the [Configuration wiki page](https://github.com/sergiula/redis-job-queue/wiki/Configuring-RJQ)

**NOTE :** You need to restart RJQ after each configuration modification :

```bash
  $ rjq --restart
```

Call this job from your application scripts (a controller action for example)
```php
<?php
require_once( '/etc/rjq/src/RedisClient.php' );
require_once( '/etc/rjq/src/RedisQueue.php' );
// init the RJQ manager
$queue = new RedisQueue(
    new RedisClient('tcp://127.0.0.1:6379', 0, null)
);
// call your job
$job = $queue->doSleep( 10, 'John Doe');
// gets the task status
echo 'Job ' . $job . ' is : ' . $queue->getJobStatus($job);
```

And `voil√†` :)
